    <span> Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic
    sentence.</span>
    Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main
    point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like
    the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t
    guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all
    the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and
    closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.
