        Paragraphs are the <span>building</span> blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group
        of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas
        among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence
        that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
        paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one
        sentence long.

        Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout,
        we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
        There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea
        of the paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:
